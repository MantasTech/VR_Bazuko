# Virtual Reality game

Repository of my personal VR project where i develop immersive virtual reality experience using Unity and C#.
Main goal of the game is to shoot incoming drones and avoid to get hit by them. Each level increases difficulty. 

Available on Oculus Quest 2 and newer devices from Meta.
